Structured abstract:
Importance
The consistent association between in-utero exposure to maternal infection or mental illness and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), suggests causality. 
Objectives
To be causal, we hypothesised there are specific in-utero effects evidenced by 1) stronger associations between infection or mental illness and NDD incidence during compared to outside of pregnancy; and 2) higher NDD incidence among exposed compared to unexposed siblings. 
Design
Cohort study. 
Setting
UK primary and secondary care dataset.
Participants
Three cohorts of children born between 1st January 1990 to 31st December 2017 and their mothers. Children were either exposed or unexposed to maternal mental illness and maternal infection during pregnancy; and/or 1 year and 2 years prior to pregnancy. A sibling cohort was constructed from the pregnancy cohort.
Exposures
Maternal exposures were identified from the primary care record. NDDs (autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and epilepsy) were extracted from the child’s primary and secondary care record. We extracted information on potential maternal confounders (age, smoking status, comorbidities, BMI, history of NDD); child confounders (gender, ethnicity, birth year); and area-level confounders (region and level of deprivation). 
Main outcomes/measures
We calculated the incidence rate of NDDs for exposed and unexposed offspring in each cohort; and compared rates using Cox-regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounders. 
Results
The analysis included 410,461 children of 297,426 mothers and 2,793,018 person-years of follow-up with 8900 NDD cases (incidence rate = 3.2 per 1000 person years). After adjustments, a moderate association with maternal mental illness was observed for each cohort (pregnancy adjusted HR=1.58, 95%CI 1.46-1.72; 1 year adj.HR=1.49, 95%CI 1.39-1.60; 2 year adj.HR=1.62, 95%CI 1.50-1.74); and to a lesser extent, of maternal infection (pregnancy adj. HR= 1.16, 95%CI 1.10-1.22; 1 year adj.HR=1.20, 95%CI 1.14-1.27; 2 year adj.HR=1.19 95%CI 1.12-1.25). There was no evidence of increased NDD risk in siblings discordant for maternal exposures during pregnancy: mental illness HR=0.98, 95%CI 0.78-1.23; infection HR=0.98, 95%CI 0.89-1.08. 
Conclusion
In this large population study, we found no specific association between maternal mental illness or infection in-utero and NDD incidence and, therefore, no causal evidence.
